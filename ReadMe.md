# pytorch project
This repository is implementation of pytorch application

## Basic implementation using pytorch
1. recurrentNet: simply implementing recurrent neural network
2. GCN: implementation of graph convolution. In present, clustering and node embedding is done

## Paper re-implementation
Following files are re-implementation of several papers.
Additional detail is written in each file.
1. GAN: In present, wgan and sin-gan is implemented.
2. Fader_Network: disentanglement of face based on encoder-decoder
3. ArcFace: metric-learning for face verification
4. channel_pruning: pruning method for convolutional layer (usually, used for model acceleration)
5. LotteryTicket: Initial version, some tricks like warmup is not implemented.
6. LotteryTicket_late_init: late resetting(described in paper) is applied. 

If you find some bags or opinions (e.g., please implementing xxx ), feel free to make an issue.
When I have time, I confirm that.
